# Weather Scout

Every ten years NOAA creates an incredible climate data set based on the past 30 years of historical data. Despite containing valuable information in the dataset, the current access tools are incredibly challenging to use, which prevents exploration. This Elixir powered Phoenix based web application combines an interactive map with a powerful location search tool, the NOAA Climate Normals dataset and some prediction techniques to create a rich exploration of what temperatures might be at any location in the United States at different points during the year.
